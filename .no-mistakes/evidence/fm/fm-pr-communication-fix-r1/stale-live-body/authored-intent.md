- **What is changing:** Members can see the status of their submitted requests.

- **Customer or business impact:** Members get clearer communication and the team saves time.
- **Risk and rollout:** Low risk. Release through staging and confirm the main request flow.

## Validation

- **Checks passed:** Unit tests and type check.
- **Checks not run:** End-to-end test was not run locally.
- **Evidence and limitations:** Tested with a representative request.
